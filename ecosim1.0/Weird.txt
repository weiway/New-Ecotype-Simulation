So I was running the es vs es2 comparison and for some reason the copy just totally died and stopped working. SO I went to a backup copy of es1 from my dropbox folder and boom it's working again. Not sure what the deal was...

Either way this ecosim is a dropbox copy what I was using that totally broke is now titled ecosim-not working? Just a little note for the future...
